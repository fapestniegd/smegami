Some bash scripts to make base amazon machine images that can bootstrap themselves into installing puppet.

most of these will need sudo until I can convert them to fakeroot...

dependencies - get the dependencies these scripts need
credentials  - load up our aws credentials
ec2-setup    - define some functions to make the rest of the scripts readable
mkubuami     - create the ubuntu ami, install custom kernel and build script
edit_ami     - mount; chroot into; unmount the image (for manual fixups)
update_ami   - {bundle, sign, ship, register} the ami, start an instance, then
               watch the console output until it stops growing, then 
               terminate the instance and unregister the AMI

bin/         - some binaries to copy to /root/bin
packages/    - some packages to copy to /usr/local/pkg and install
scripts/     - some script to run out of rc.local (to fetch puppet manifests)
